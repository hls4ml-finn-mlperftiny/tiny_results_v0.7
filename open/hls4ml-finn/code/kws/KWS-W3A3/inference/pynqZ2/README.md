## Build stitched-IP for MLPerf tiny and bitfile for PYNQ

The build is currently configured for the PYNQ-Z2 board and a throughput of about 200k FPS at a clock frequency of 100 MHz.

1. Copy the trained `QONNX_model.onnx` model from the training folder. The command is: `cp ../../training/training_checkpoint/QONNX_model.onnx .`
2. (Optional) Download the pre-processed validation data using the `get-kws-data.sh` script.
3. Launch the build as follows:
```shell
# cd to where the FINN compiler was cloned to
cd ../finn
# launch the build on the build foler
bash run-docker.sh build_custom ../pynqZ2
```

4. The generated outputs will be exported to a folder called `<timestamp>_output_<onnx_file_name>_<platform>`. 
You can find a description of the generated files [here](https://finn-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#simple-dataflow-build-mode).
The folder will additionally include the quantized inputs for verification (`all_validation_KWS_data_inputs_len_10102.npy`) and the expected outputs (`all_validation_KWS_data_outputs_len_10102.npy`).
When running the network on hardware the validation should achieve an accuracy of just below 89 %. Note that this accuracy is NOT the test accuracy.

## Creating the bare metal application for MLPerf tiny
The following steps are adapted from original instructions by Giuseppe:

1. Make sure the shell has access to the Vivado 2019.1 tools and SDK.
2. Run the Vivado project script: 

```shell
cd vivado_project/sys
make sys-hlsmover
```

3. The Vivado script essentially opens the FINN project and exports the HDF file for the SDK in the directory `vivado_project/sdk/hdf/`. Note that when we use HLS datamovers we don't have to create our own Vivado project (as with the AXI DMA IP).
4. Finally, let's create the SDK project + running it:
```shell
cd vivado_project/sdk
make sdk-hlsmover
make gui
```
5. This will pop up the SDK, close the "welcome" tab and you should have the baremetal app.
6. The SDK project now contains all harness files to build the harness and run the accelerator + harness on the FPGA.
